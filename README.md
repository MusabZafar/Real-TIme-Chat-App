# Real-TIme-Chat-App
The Chatter Backend project is a personal learning journey where I’ve built a scalable, production-grade full-stack chat application. The goal of this project is to help me gain hands-on experience with NestJS, GraphQL, MongoDB, and React while learning how to deploy a real-world application to AWS.
